# SE-formative
This project is part of the Software Engineering formative assignment. The project will use a simple HTML UI page, along with a Kanban like board in the Git project management tool. 

---

## Purpose

A simple HTML page, where users can easily navigate to the iconic "Tears in Rain" monologue from the 1982 film Blade Runner YouTube scene or Spotify soundtrack. This famous speech, delivered by character Roy Batty in one of the most memorable death scenes in science fiction cinema, has been widely quoted and remains a classic of the genre. We hope you enjoy this tribute to one of the most memorable moments in film history."

## Project Management 

![project_board](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120586818/208093458-a39e1d39-00d8-472a-bdbd-2a5a88196d9c.png)
    
In this project, I use GitHub's Project Tracker to manage issues and follow the kanban methodology. This allows me to continuously improve and visualize my workflow on a regular basis, organizing tasks according to priority. By using the Project Tracker, I am able to maintain an efficient and effective workflow.

The workflow will work as such:

Raise issue -> To do -> move to In progress when work begins -> create pull request and move issue and pull request to review -> once finalised merge pull request and move issue to Done

## Prototyping

To kick off my project, I began conceptualizing the design of the HTML file using Figma, a cloud-based design tool. I imported screenshots into Figma to gather inspiration and settled on a color palette. From there, I designed two prototypes.

The screenshot provided above shows the two prototypes designed in Figma and the other items contained in the workspace.

The prototype selected as the final page is prototype 1. This is sits in the repository as ![Prototype.png](https://github.com/lford93/SE-formative/blob/main/Prototype%201.png)

### Prototype testing

Using the Figma presentation mode the prototype can be testing to ensure it works as intended. The only function the prototype (and final build) offers are two clickable icons. The icons should direct the user to the YouTube channel MovieClips to watch the famous "tears in the rain" Blade Runner scene. The spotify icon should take the user to the official soundtrack "Tears in the rain" for Blade Runner.

The page loads as intended when viewing the prototype

The youtube icon takes me to the intended YouTube video using the prototype.

And so does the Spotify link.

The prototype is operated as intended.
