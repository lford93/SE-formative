# SE-formative
This project is part of the Software Engineering formative assignment. The project will use a simple HTML UI page, along with a Kanban like board in the Git project management tool.

## Purpose

A simple HTML page, where users can easily navigate to the iconic "Tears in Rain" monologue from the 1982 film Blade Runner YouTube scene or Spotify soundtrack. This famous speech, delivered by character Roy Batty in one of the most memorable death scenes in science fiction cinema, has been widely quoted and remains a classic of the genre. We hope you enjoy this tribute to one of the most memorable moments in film history."

## Project Management 

![project_board](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120586818/208093458-a39e1d39-00d8-472a-bdbd-2a5a88196d9c.png)
    
In this project, I use GitHub's Project Tracker to manage issues and follow the kanban methodology. This allows me to continuously improve and visualize my workflow on a regular basis, organizing tasks according to priority. By using the Project Tracker, I am able to maintain an efficient and effective workflow.

The workflow will work as such:

Raise issue -> To do -> move to In progress when work begins -> create pull request and move issue and pull request to review -> once finalised merge pull request and move issue to Done

## Prototyping

In order to begin my project, I started conceptualising the design of the HTML file in Figma. Figma is a cloud-based design tool. I was able to paste screenshots into the Figma enviroment to get some inspiration for what I have created. I could also decide a colour palette. Two prototypes were designed.

The screenshot provided above shows the two prototypes designed in Figma and the other items contained in the workspace.

The prototype selected as the final page is prototype 1. This is sits in the repository as ![Prototype.png](https://github.com/lford93/SE-formative/blob/main/Prototype%201.png)
